		<p>In response to ever-growing concerns for the environment and consumer avidity for eco- friendly products, U.S Green Building Council member Stage 5 Staging, is proud to announce that its products are "going green" on a large scale. This change will take place both on the Staging side of the business and in the Railing Concepts division.</p>
		
		<p>Over the past two years Stage 5 Staging has been progressively adding eco-friendly materials to product lines. With a newly found source for obtaining recycled aluminum have increased its contributions to green building substantially. The ability to incorporate recycled aluminum into the new Railing Concepts division's product line will allow for a much needed boost to recycled content contributions in the ornamental railing market. The Railing Concepts division is excited that it has the opportunity to be the first of its kind to offer eco-friendly products to stadiums, arenas, and other major venues around the country.</p>
